Embedded and cyber physical
Cyber physical  systems more or less sit on the same principles with embedded systems.

Modelling, Design, Analysis
Modelling is the process of gaining a deeper understanding of a system through imitation.
Models express what a system does or should do. 

Design is the structured creation of artifacts. It specifies how a system does what it does.

Analysis is the process of gaining a deeper understanding of a system through dissection. It 
specifies why a system does what it does (or fails to do what a model says it should do).
